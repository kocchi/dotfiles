Fork the plugin repository.\n1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.\n1. Commit and push the topic branch.\n1. Make a pull request.\n1. welcome to the club\n\nPlease note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:\n\n- Indent is 2 spaces.\n- Code should pass coffeelint linter.\n- Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it.\n\nThank you for helping out!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/s-shin/linter-perl/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/s-shin/linter-perl","_id":"linter-perl@0.5.1","_shasum":"24ee4e08b4730f23208483055db99b5bf828d60d","_resolved":"file:../d-115526-26465-1u7mwgt/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115526-26465-1u7mwgt/package.tgz"}
